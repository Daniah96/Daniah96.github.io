### CPSC 120

* lab 2

    I learned about the significance of proper syntax in Lab 2, Part 2 for writing efficient and dependable code. An key takeaway from this lesson was that I should always check my syntax before running any code. I was able to prevent many typical mistakes and create programs that were more effective by carefully analyzing my code and making sure the syntax was accurate. I learned the benefits of using a website like GitHub to practice and study computer science in this lab. On the site, I was able to collaborate with others and share my code, which allowed me to learn from my peers and develop my abilities. Additionally, I obtained useful expertise working with version control, a crucial tool for any computer 

   *  Lab 5

     i learnt how to write a program that would allow us to compute the arithmetic mean (or average) of a given statement in Lab 5, Part 2. In this section of the assignment, doubles were an intriguing instrument to employ to store floats for our equations, improving their accuracy. It was challenging, but it truly helped me grasp the fundamentals of coding.

   *  Lab 7
   
     Since we learned how to operate a scoreboard in an earlier lab, I really enjoyed part 2 of this lab, making it my all-time favorite lab. Using booleans has also made it easier for me to comprehend how to use functions based on their core concept of usages! Although it was challenging initially, I now understand how to use booleans correctly and play Blackjack as we
